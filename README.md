All of the individual state-level data are publicly available. We have included information regarding how to obtain the data for each state in the supplement including the necessary links Efforts are currently underway to work with each individual health department, adhering to their specific data protection procedures, to compile all of the state-level data into a single database that will be publicly available through ICPSR. Further, in the current investigation, we analyzed each state separately and thus downloading each state individually will allow for replicability.
